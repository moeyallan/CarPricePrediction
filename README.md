# CarPricePrediction
# Car Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop predictive models to forecast car sale prices based on various vehicle attributes. Utilizing regression models and decision trees, we seek to provide accurate price estimations that can aid stakeholders in the automotive industry.

## Project Stages
- **Data Collection**: Gathering datasets relevant to car sales.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing data to handle missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Model Development**: Developing regression and decision tree models.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RÂ², MAE, and RMSE.
- **Conclusion**: Drawing conclusions and providing recommendations based on our findings.

## Repository Content
- `processes2.csv`:  this is the dataset used in the project.
- `car_data_analyzed.ipynb`: Google colab of files for data analysis and model development where there is a link imbeded for the actual colab 
- `DATA REPRT CAR.pdf`: Compiled technical reports in PDF format.
